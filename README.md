# NerdMiner RIG

**The NerdSoloMiner v2**

I designed a dedicated PCB to work as Mining RIG for up to 4 ESP Boards with NerdMiner v2 Software. No fancy display at this time. Another ESP8266 controls SSD1306 Display for showing current status of Minig Pool, date & time and maybe some other info in the future...
This project assumess learning some Arduino IDE coding and save some space for your miners (more performance, less design).

## Requirements

### Hardware

- PCB
- ESP32-WROOM-32, ESP32-Devkit1 (30 pin Board)
- ESP8266 D1 Mini
- SSD 1306 Display

### Software

- [Arduino IDE 2.0](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- [NerdMiner v2 Firmware](https://github.com/BitMaker-hub/NerdMiner_v2) or [NM2 flasher online](https://flasher.bitronics.store/)

## Build
